    <h1> Your first Website</h1>
    <section>
        <p class="bold-font">
            Recreate this simple website using all the skills we learnt in the last couple of weeks
        </p>
        <p class="very-fancy-paragraph bold-font">
            You will need both HTML (be careful to use the proper structure!) and various CSS rules. This paragraph has
            a lightgray
            background color and slightly rounded edges. Make sure the text does not protrude from the background
            despite the
            rounded corners.
        </p>
        <h3>Paragraphs which are siblings to a h1 which is a direct descendent of an article use bold font. </h3>
        <h3> Task 1 </h3>
        <section class="highlighted-sections body">
        <p>
            <strong> General Body Rules </strong>
        <ul>
            <li> Uses a font without serifs</li>
            <li> Has a 10% margin all around </li>
            <li> All values have to be relative </li>

        </ul>
            Some sections are highlighted:
            <ul>
                <li> They have a green, dashed border </li>
                <li> A bit of padding </li>
                <li> Some top & bottom margins (but not left or right margins)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <h2> Special List</h2>
        <section>
            <ul class = b>
                <li>An unordered list in a section which directly succeeds another section</li>
                <li>Uses circle as bullet points</li>
                <li class="red-item">Except for this one item which decided to use a square and color itself red</li>
            </ul>

        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Heading in a section</h3>
        A h1 in a section uses italic. Those in an article do not.
